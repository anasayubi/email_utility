# Workflow
- Activate the correct environment that has all the correct dependencies installed via `source activate email-conf-registry`
- Adopt Readme Driven Development (RDD) as defined [here](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
- Use [`grip`](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) to view the markdown file as it will be rendered on Github. To run grip do the following:
  - `$ grip [name-of-file] -b` -> opens a browser window automatically
